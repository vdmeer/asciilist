ASCII List
==========

Many different lists (itemize/unordered, enumerate/ordered, checklist, description) with support for nested lists, using ASCII and UTF characters for labels.

The lists allow for various degrees of flexibility for labels, nested lists, indentation (with auto-indentation for nested lists), and styles for list labels.
