Features
--------

The package offers a number of different lists.
Some of those lists come with specific configuration options.

- Itemize lists (as in LaTeX `itemize` or HTML `ul`)
- Enumerate lists (as in LaTeX `enumerate` or HTML `ol`)
- Check lists with items being checked or not checked
- Description lists (as in LaTeX `description`)

The lists come with several options to add content and to configure render options:

- Add items as plain text, collection of objects, or other lists
  ** checklist items can be added as a checked or not checked item
  ** description list items can be added with title and content of the description
  ** adding lists as item will create nested lists of any combination
- Set width of the overall list, with automated line wrapping for overlength item text
- Set indentation and string before and after the list label
- Enumerate lists can set a label separator
- Description lists can be one line or two lines, with flexible indentation
- Set level of items manually
- Set list style, with a large number of different pre-defined styles available
