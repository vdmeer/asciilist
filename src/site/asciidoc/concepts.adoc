Concepts
--------

The main concepts are: list, item, label, style.

List
~~~~
A list is a collection of items.
The content and form of the items depends on the list.
Lists can be:

* Itemize or unordered - simple items with same label
* Enumerate or ordered - simple items, ordered, with individual label
* Checklist - items that have a label showing that they are checked or unchecked
* Description or definition or labeled - items that have a term and a description
* FAQ or Q&amp;A - items that have an question and an answer, can be itemize or enumerate


Lists items can contain other lists. This feature results in nested lists.
If lists of the same type are nested the label itself of the label style can be a continuation of the parent list.

Lists are created and filled.
Then lists can be configured to get the expected printed output.
Finally, a list is rendered, i.e. a printable representation of the list and all its items is created.



Item
~~~~
An item is the actual content of a list.
Simple items have only some text.
More complex items have several parts, for instance the term and description of a description list.
Some items have text plus other configuration options, such as items in a checklist.



Label
~~~~~
A label is the marker of an item.
Labels strongly depend on the particular list.
Most configuration on lists is actually on the label.

The following concepts are used in the lists here for labels:

* Pre-label indentation - is the indentation used before the label. This is the first set of characters printed.
* Pre-label string - is a string printed before every label of a list. This is printed after the pre-label indentation, as the second set of characters.
* Label - the actual label, for instance "*" or "-" for itemize or "1." and "1.1." for enumerate lists.
* Post-label string - is a string printed right after every label of a list.
* Post-label indentation - is the indentation after the label (and before the item's content).
* Multi-line indentation - is used in some lists for the indentation from the second line onwards (if lines are wrapped).

All lists allow to manipulate the pre/post label characteristics directly.
The label can be styled using a style.
Multi-line indentation do only apply for some lists, where it cannot or should not be calculated automatically.



Style
~~~~~
Styles are used to style labels of lists or of nested lists.
The style of a label depends on the particular list.
Most lists in this package provide a number of different styles.

Styles for nested lists are used if those lists are a continuation.
These styles allow to change the label style in nested lists.
For some lists (e.g. enumerate) they also allow to re-use parts of the parent list for the label.
